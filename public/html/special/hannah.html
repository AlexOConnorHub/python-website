    <p>Hannah, you are such an amazing person. You have put up with a lot over your life, yet you are still the most caring person I know, and still found room in your heart to let me in. Thank you for letting me see how much of an amazing person you are!
        I love you Hannah</p>

<h1 id="beautiful">beautiful</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Hannah, you are so beautiful. From the inside, you care so much, no matter what you are going through. It's so beautiful to have a best friend like you. On the outside, it doesn't matter if you just woke up, how you do your hair,</p>

<h1 id="creative">creative</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Hannah, you are so creative! From the HA infinity logo, to the hands painting, to my favorite cube. I can't wait to see how many other ways you're creative, and maybe, just maybe, I'll eventually have a good, creative idea too.</p>

<h1 id="daring">daring</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Hannah, you are such a daring person. You dared risk saying yes to being my girl friend. You risked being broken. I never want to break you. I'll prove I'll be with you forever. I love you so much, and that will never change. Thanks for taking the
        daring risk.</p>

<h1 id="endless">endless</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Hannah, you are endless. No matter how much I get to know you, it will just show how much more I get to know about you. Everything I've gotten to know about you so far has shown me how wonderful you are, and I cannot wait to find out more reasons
        you are amazing!</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="fragile">fragile</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Hannah, one of the most unique things I love about you is how fragile you are. If there is any reason for you to think a friend doesn't want to be around you any more, it hurts you. Thanks you for trusting me with your fragile heart. It hurts me in
        ways I never knew I could hurt when I've hurt you. I'm sorry every time I do, and I'm grateful you continue to trust me with your heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="great">great</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Hannah, you are such a great person! Sadly, history tells us of the many bad people, and those who faught then then. If history told of those who were the best influence in everyone's life they were involved in, you would be one of those people. You
        are such a wonderful influence in everyone's life. I'm so glad I have you in my life.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="heartfelt">heartfelt</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Hannah, everything you do is from your heart. I love that, whether it's because you are annoyed at someone, or because you appreciate someone, it's from the heart. I never have to guess if you ment something. I never have to wonder if you just did
        something to make me feel better, I know you ment it. I'm the same way, know I mean &quot;I love you&quot; from the bottom of my heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="independent">independent</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Hannah, you are such an independent woman. Thank you for letting me in, even though you became a little less independent. I love how you could survive on your own, but you decided you could stand me in your life, and you could enjoy it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="joyful">joyful</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Hannah, no matter what what you feel like, you always want those around you to be joyful. You're such a cheery spirit for everyone you meet. I'm glad I can always come to you if I need to be cheered up, and I'm glad I know how to cheer up my best
        friend. I love you so much Hannah.</p>

<h1 id="kind">kind</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Hannah, you are such a kind person. You have seen such a dark side of this world, yet you have not let it take away your kindness. Please remember that your kindness is one of the things I love about you the most, and I hope you never lose it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="loving">loving</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Hannah, you are such a loving person. I love that the woman I love loves me back, and that makes me love you even more. You have shown me what it means to love, and be loved by someone I can completely trust with anything. Thank you for loving me,
        you will always have a spacial spot in my heart, and it's not going anywhere but deeper.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="modest">modest</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Hannah, no matter what you do, you are always so modest. You never want to be the center of attention, even if you deserve it all. Remember, even though Johan and Martha joke about who did more for us, you did the most. At the end of the day, you
        asked me if I liked you. You asked to go on walks every night (which is how I fell in love with you)</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="nice">nice</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Hannah, you are the nicest person I know! As you've noticed, I can smile and wave at almost anyone on campus, and they know my face. You, on the other hand, are the person who I can't smile and wave at, I have to hug and hold hands with. You are the
        nicest person in my life, and I never want that to change.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="out-of-this-world">out-of-this-world</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Hannah, you are so out-of-this-world! You mean the world to me. I never knew how needed a best friend was. I never knew why God said &quot;it is not good that man should be alone&quot;. I never knew how alone I truely was. Having a best friend and
        someone to share anything with has been a very out-of-this-world experience, and I am enjoying it, but not as much as I love you.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="prefect">prefect</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Hannah, you are so perfect. No matter how many things you see as flaws, know they are there to make you more perfect. Everything that happens forms who we are, and who you are is someone who is perfect for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="queen">queen</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Hannah, you are my queen. You are who I will always look to protect. You are who I want the world for. You are my world, and I cannot wait to be my queen's right hand man.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="resilient">resilient</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Hannah, you are such a resilient woman. You have been through more than your fair share, yet you still press on. You even left your heart open for me. Thanks for that. Keep pushing forward! I'm here for you when you need a bit of help, no matter how
        small or big. You are an inspiration, and a reason for me to keep going.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="stunnin">stunnin</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Hannah, you are stunnin! No matter what you do, or how you do it, you find a way to do it in style. You can always find a positive in anything, which is stunnin in itself. And of course, anyone with eyes can see how stunnin you are, and I'm glad that
        this stunnin girl is mine.</p>

<h1 id="talkitive">talkitive</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Hannah, there are many talkitive people in the world, and if I liked listening to people talked, I would have many options. But I don't like just listening to people talk, I love listening to my Hannah talking. You're the only person I can listen
        to for hours on end and never get annoyed that you're still talking</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="unmistakeable">unmistakeable</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Hannah, you are unmistakeable. In your lovely poems, you always find a way to let your unique hummor shine, lighting up the day of anyone around to hear it. In you everyday life, your impact on those around you is unmistakeable. You find a way to
        help others no matter what, and that is so rare, and one of the many reasons I love you.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="vital">vital</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Hannah, you are vital. I cannot imagine a world in which I never met you. While I have only known you for a few months, you have made such a huge impact on my life. I know my life would be totally different, and maybe not for the better, if I had
        never met such a vital, awesome woman.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="wonderful">wonderful</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Hannah, you are so wonderful. The moment I realized that I had fallen in love with you, is the moment I wondered what life would be like without you by my side. That's how wonderful you truly are. By just being in my life, you made me realized I could
        not imagine a world without you in my life. I'm glad you will always be in my life Hannah</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="extraordinary">extraordinary</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Hannah, you are extraordinary. Yes, I know I'm cheating on this one... but can you believe that the entire English language doesn't have a world that starts with &quot;X&quot; that descrbes you! That's how extraordinary you truely are. You are such
        a blessing, and a once in a lifetime friend.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="young">young</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Hannah, no matter how much we joke, you're still young. Being young is great! We get to enjoy hiking, playing volleyball, and napping! No matter how young or old, napping will always be fun with you. I cannot wait to grow old with you.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="zappy">zappy</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Hannah, you are zappy. If you would have to look up this word's meaning like I would, I'll help you out. It means that you are full of energy, whether or not you had a coffee or two. You have enough energy to enjoy a hike, and then you have enough
        energy to cuddle with me and fall asleep. You have just the right amount of energy for whatever we plan on doing.</p>
