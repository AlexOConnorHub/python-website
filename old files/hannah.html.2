    <h1 class='center'>Hey Hannah </h1>

    <p>
        <span>In case I don't say it enough, I love you.</span><br>
        <span>I cannot imagine what my life would be like without you in it</span><br>
        <span>I miss you more than I ever though I could miss one person</span><br>
        <span>I hate that this is true, but I didn't miss anyone at home when I moved off to college</span><br>
        <span>On the other hand, after just one month, I miss you</span><br>
        <span>You have shown me what it means to have a friend that cares</span><br>
        <span>What it means to have a friend that is there no matter what</span><br>
        <span>What it means to have a best friend, seriously, I have never let someone be so close to me</span><br>
        <span>While it seems that I know a lot of people, and that may be true</span><br>
        <span>I tend to be a private person, and I don't share much of what is actually happening in my world with others</span><br>
        <span>I'm glad God gave me someone that can be for me what I try to be for her</span><br>
        <span>Thank you for being such a good friend, a bes fwend, my girlfriend</span><br>
        <span>I love you Hannah, I miss you Hannah</span><br>
